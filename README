The code here was written to setup and tear down an experimental setup for a graduate level computer networks course.  The experiments involved starting BitTorrent clients across 8 virtual machines located on a remote server at the University of New Mexico.

The scripts primarily used pexpect to interact with each system and were created to get things running quickly.
